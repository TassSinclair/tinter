# Tinter
Tints an image with a variety of colours and saves the resulting images, so you can choose which ones you like best.

Colours are from the [ThoughtWorks](https://thoughtworks.com) colour palette.

## Requirements

* Bash 4 or newer. Prolly comes with your Mac or Linux distro.
* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/). Your package manager (apt, brew, etc...) should have it.

## Usage
```
./tinter.sh image.jpg
```

Lighten or darken to taste in Keynote or Google Slides, if using the outputs as a background image.
